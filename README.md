# Basic Setup
This is a basic setup i've created. It lacks any front-end styling/component libraries and also any backend model/database structure. The idea I have in mind is to use this as a run-way to quickly get an idea into development-phase. The main motivation for this repo is still for me to gain experiences in setting up projects. Thanks for reading! :)
